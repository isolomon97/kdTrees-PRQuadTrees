# KD-Trees and PR-QuadTrees


In this project you will implement **KD-Trees** and **P-R
(Point-Region) QuadTrees**.  You will have to implement **both**
dictionary and spatial query functionality. You will be tested against
unit tests hosted on the department's submit server.

Half of this project is the study of spatial data structures and half
the practice of Object-Oriented Programming primitives, in particular,
*Inheritance* and *Polymorphism*.  You will need to spend some time
studying the provided documentation and code structure, in order to
understand how the various components are pieced together.
